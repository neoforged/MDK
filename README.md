# For mod developers
If you're looking to start out with NeoForge, please check [the dedicated MDK organization](https://github.com/NeoForgeMDKs) for more information and the list of per-version MDKs.  
This repository contains the source for the [MDK Mirrors](https://github.com/NeoForgeMDKs).  

# Mirrors
Each branch with a `1.*` name will get a mirror repository created automatically under the [NeoForgeMDKs](https://github.com/NeoForgeMDKs) organization. That mirror will be kept in constant sync with its upstream branch automatically.  
The format of the repository name is `MDK-<mc version>-<plugin>`, where `plugin` is either [`NeoGradle`](https://github.com/neoforged/NeoGradle) (default), or [`ModDevGradle`](https://github.com/neoforged/moddevgradle) (if the branch name has the `-mdg` suffix).

## Contributing
PRs to the mirror repositories will not be accepted. Contributions should target this repository.
